- Allows you to mount a snapshot as a searchable snapshot (enterprise license required).
- Allows you to delete one or more indexes.
- It shows the percentage of disk space occupied by each of the nodes that make up the ElasticSearch cluster.
- It does not allow operations on the indexes of the system, for security reasons.
